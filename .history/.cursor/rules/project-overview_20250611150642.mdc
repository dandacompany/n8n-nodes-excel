# Project Overview

This project is a Node.js Express server that functions as a local database, using Excel files for storage.

## Key Components

-   **Main Server Logic**: The entire server is contained within [index.js](mdc:index.js). It handles all API requests for reading, creating, and modifying Excel files.
-   **Data Storage**: Excel files used as the database are stored in the `data/` directory. All API operations read from or write to files within this folder.
-   **API Documentation**: The [README.md](mdc:README.md) file contains detailed instructions on how to set up the server and use the different API endpoints, including `curl` examples.
